    <h1>Argentina: Traditions and Dance</h1>

    <h2>Cultural Traditions</h2>
    <p>Argentina is a country rich in culture and tradition. One of the most beloved customs is the <strong>Asado</strong>, a social barbecue gathering where families and friends enjoy grilled meats. Another important tradition is drinking <strong>mate</strong>, a herbal tea shared among people as a sign of friendship and hospitality.</p>

    <p>Argentinians also celebrate national holidays with parades, music, and traditional food. Family and community are central to Argentine life, and many customs reflect this strong social bond.</p>

    <h2>Traditional Dance: The Tango</h2>
    <p>The most famous dance from Argentina is the <strong>Tango</strong>. It originated in Buenos Aires in the late 1800s and combines African, European, and local influences. Tango is known for its dramatic movements, close embrace, and emotional expression.</p>

    <p>Other traditional dances include the <strong>Chacarera</strong> and <strong>Malambo</strong>. The Chacarera is a lively folk dance from northern Argentina, while the Malambo is a fast-paced dance performed by men, showcasing footwork and rhythm.</p>
